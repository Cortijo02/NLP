It's crucial to have a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the crash.\\\"\\n\\nSheriff Villanueva justified the decision not to use a DRE by citing the deputy's assessment of Woods as lucid and showing no signs of impairment. However, some experts argue that this assessment may not be reliable, as Woods may have been inattentive or asleep at the time of the crash.\\n\\n\\\"The deputy's assessment may not have been thorough enough, and it's possible that Woods was impaired without showing any obvious signs,\\\" said John Schloegl, a sheriff's deputy. \\\"A DRE assessment would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of Woods' condition at the time of the crash.\\\"\\n\\nChris Taylor, managing attorney at Taylor & Taylor, added, \\\"The lack of a DRE assessment raises questions about the thoroughness of the investigation and whether all possible causes of the crash were considered. It's important to get to the bottom of what happened and ensure that justice is served.\\\"\\n\\nTiger Woods suffered broken bones in his right leg and facial injuries in the crash, but no head injuries were reported. The investigation is ongoing, and officials are working to determine the cause of the crash and whether any charges will be filed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the decisions made by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department during the Tiger Woods car crash investigation are being scrutinized by experts, who argue that a DRE assessment should have been conducted at the scene. While the investigation is ongoing, it's clear that a thorough evaluation of Woods' condition at the time of the crash is crucial to determining the cause of the crash and ensuring justice is served.\",\n          \"Investigation into Tiger Woods' Car Crash Concludes; Cause Remains Private\\n\\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced the conclusion of the investigation into Tiger Woods' car crash in California, but the cause of the accident remains private due to privacy issues requested by Woods' team. Officials have reached out to Woods and his personnel about waiving privacy to release the investigation information.\\n\\n\\\"A cause has been determined, the investigation has concluded, but we cannot disclose it based on the privacy issues we're facing,\\\" Villanueva said during a press conference. \\\"We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel, but have not received a response.\\\"\\n\\nThe single-vehicle crash occurred on February 23, with Woods' car, a Genesis GV80, hitting a sign, shearing through a tree, and landing in the brush with major damage. Deputy Johann Schloegl, a traffic collision investigator, revealed that Woods had no recollection of driving or how the crash happened in a search warrant affidavit for the vehicle's black box.\\n\\nSchloegl noted, \\\"The driver had no recollection of the collision. Deputy Schloegl also noted that a witness reported Woods was unconscious initially at the crash scene.\\\" However, according to the affidavit, Woods was unconscious at some point after the crash, but conscious when deputies arrived.\\n\\nWoods underwent emergency surgery for significant injuries to his right lower extremity after the crash and returned home in mid-March for recovery. A source close to Tiger Woods, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told PEOPLE that Woods is focused on recovery and feeling lucky to be alive.\\n\\n\\\"Tiger is just grateful he survived and has access to amazing medical care,\\\" the source said. \\\"He's concentrating on his recovery, and appreciates all the support he's received from family, friends, and fans.\\\"\\n\\nOn social media, Woods confirmed that he returned home and reunited with his children, expressing gratitude for the support and love he received during his recovery.\\n\\n\\\"I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks,\\\" Woods wrote on Twitter. \\\"Thank you to the incredible surgeons, nurses, and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. You have truly helped me feel and recover more than I ever thought possible.\\\"\\n\\nWoods' accident was a significant setback for the golfer, who has faced numerous injuries and surgeries throughout his career. However, the investigation's conclusion and Woods' focus on recovery provide hope for the future.\\n\\nAs Woods continues to heal, fans and supporters are eager to see him back on the golf course, doing what he loves. For now, though, privacy and rest remain the top priorities for the golfing legend.\\n\\n\\\"Tiger's recovery is going as well as can be expected, but it's a long road ahead,\\\" the source said. \\\"He's taking it one day at a time and focusing on his health and wellbeing.\\\"\\n\\nWoods' commitment to his health and wellbeing is evident in the care he is receiving and the progress he has made since the accident. Only time will tell when he will return to the sport, but fans remain hopeful that the investigation's conclusion will bring him one step closer to doing so.\\n\\n\\\"Tiger Woods is a true champion, and we know that he will come back stronger than ever,\\\" a fan said outside Woods' home. \\\"He has always been an inspiration to us all, and we are excited to see what the future holds for him.\\\"\\n\\nUntil then, Woods will continue to focus on his recovery, surrounded by the love and support of his family, friends, and fans.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_human\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_machine\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In addition to the suspension, YouTube has disabled all comments on Trump's channel indefinitely. This move comes in the wake of Trump's permanent ban from Twitter and his ban on Facebook at least until President-elect Biden's inauguration.\\n\\nJim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, praised YouTube's decision as an 'important and necessary first step' and even suggested that the suspension should become permanent. With social media companies increasingly cracking down on the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence, YouTube's actions signal a growing trend in holding public figures accountable for their online presence.\\n\\nIn a related move to curb misinformation, Google announced a temporary pause on political ads on its platforms until after Inauguration Day. The intention behind this decision is to prevent the further spread of misinformation and the exploitation of the recent events at the US Capitol.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the social networking app Parler, popular among conservative audiences, found itself in hot water after being removed by Amazon Web Services and various app stores. In response, Parler registered its domain with Epik, a domain registrar known for hosting far-right services. Moreover, Parler is taking legal action against Amazon, alleging antitrust violations over its expulsion from the tech giant's hosting services.\\n\\nThe tech industry's efforts to combat misinformation extend beyond just social media platforms. Apple recently made headlines by announcing new projects related to its $100 million pledge for racial equity and justice. The company's commitment to addressing societal issues through financial contributions and initiatives underscores the growing trend of corporate social responsibility in the tech sector.\\n\\nIn other news, Lars Lehne has been appointed as the group CEO of Incubeta, a digital marketing agency. Additionally, Julie Eddleman has joined DoubleVerify as EVP and global chief commercial officer, bringing her extensive experience in the media and tech industry to her new role.\\n\\nAs tech companies continue to navigate the complex landscape of online content moderation and combatting misinformation, these recent developments highlight the industry's evolving stance on accountability, transparency, and responsible digital citizenship.\",\n          \"Amazon Suspends AWS Services to Parler Amid Demands from Employees\\n\\nThe employee group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ) has successfully influenced Amazon's climate change policies and labor practices, and now they are calling for the tech giant to sever its cloud services to Parler. The social media platform, known for its free speech ethos popular among President Trump's supporters, became notorious for hosting violent threats and calls for weapons at the presidential inauguration.\\n\\nAmazon employees urged AWS, Amazon's cloud computing division, to deny services to Parler until it removes violent incitement posts. Their pleas were heeded on Saturday when Amazon announced the suspension of AWS services to Parler. If the social media company fails to find a new cloud provider, the site could potentially go offline.\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC, Parler CEO John Matze accused Amazon, Google, and Apple of colluding to eliminate competition. Google removed Parler from its Play Store, and Apple threatened to remove it from its App Store. According to Matze, \\\"Every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too on the same day.\\\"\\n\\nDespite reports of suspension, Parler was accessible to CNBC staff early Sunday morning Eastern Coast time. The company's website displayed a message stating, \\\"We will resolve any challenge before us and plan to welcome all of you back soon.\\\"\\n\\nAmazon's AWS has a policy against its services being used for illegal or harmful purposes. AECJ called on Amazon to adhere to their own policy by denying service to Parler. The employee group tweeted, \\\"We cannot be complicit in more bloodshed and violent attacks on our democracy.\\\"\\n\\nParler has been criticized for its lack of content moderation. The platform's laissez-faire approach to regulating user-generated content attracted supporters of President Trump who felt that traditional social media platforms censored their speech. However, this lack of regulation led to an influx of violent threats, calling for weapons at the presidential inauguration.\\n\\nParler's downfall began when Google removed it from their Play Store, and Apple threatened to follow suit. Without access to these app stores, Parler's user base was significantly reduced since Android and iOS smartphones dominate the mobile device market.\\n\\nAmazon's decision to suspend AWS services to Parler could cripple the social media platform, giving it no choice but to find a new cloud provider. Matze and his team are working tirelessly to find a solution. In an interview with Fox News, he said, \\\"We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible.\\\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the controversy surrounding Parler reflects the broader debate over free speech and content moderation on social media platforms. The decision to suspend AWS services to Parler highlights the power that cloud computing providers have over social media companies. As AECJ continues to pressure Amazon to adhere to their policy, the future of Parler remains uncertain.\",\n          \"Trump Defiant in North Carolina: Attacks Democrats, Critics and Biden, Hints at 2024 Run.

The attack, which began on May 7, forced the major fuel supplier to shut down its operations, leading to fuel shortages and price hikes along the East Coast.\\n\\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco highlighted the significance of the recovery, stating, \\\"This is the first of many steps we will take to increase the cost and consequences of ransomware attacks, cybercrime, and hacking activities by transnational organized crime.\\\" She added, \\\"We will continue to use all of our tools and resources to increase the cost and consequences of ransomware attacks and other cyber-enabled attacks.\\\"\\n\\nPaul Abbate, FBI Deputy Director, explained that the bureau was able to track the payment and identify the digital currency wallet used by the hackers. \\\"Through our ransomware task force and our partners, we were able to follow the money in this case and make this significant recovery,\\\" Abbate said.\\n\\nColonial Pipeline's President and Chief Executive, Joseph Blount, expressed his support for the operation, saying, \\\"We are grateful for the exceptional work of the Department of Justice and the FBI in recovering a significant portion of the ransom payment.\\\" Blount also emphasized the importance of holding hackers accountable, acknowledging that the decision to pay the ransom was a difficult one.\\n\\nStephanie Hinds, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, echoed the sentiment, stating, \\\"This case demonstrates our commitment to bringing to justice those who prey on American companies and infrastructure.\\\"\\n\\nRansomware attacks, in which hackers encrypt a victim's data and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key, have surged in recent years, targeting critical industries across the globe. The Colonial Pipeline incident brought the issue to the forefront of national security concerns, prompting the Biden administration to establish a ransomware task force.\\n\\nDespite the FBI's discouragement of ransom payments, the agency acknowledges that prompt engagement with law enforcement can sometimes aid in the recovery of funds. The successful recovery in the Colonial Pipeline case may set a precedent for future responses to such attacks and serve as a warning to cybercriminals that their actions will not go unpunished.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_tuple\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          [\n            1,\n            0\n          ],\n          [\n            0,\n            1\n          ]\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
